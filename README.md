# File Compression and Encryption Tool For TempleOS (R.I.P Terry A. Davis 15.12.1969 - 11.8.2018 [*])

This program is designed to provide functionalities for compressing and encrypting files.

## Features

### Startup Actions

- **Startup Sound:** Plays a sequence of musical notes to signify program startup.
- **Startup Image:** Displays an image upon program launch.

### Menu Options

1. **Compress Folder:** Allows the user to select a folder to compress and specify the output path for the compressed file.
2. **Decompress File:** Enables the user to select a file to decompress and specify the output folder.
3. **Encrypt File:** Selects a file to encrypt and specify the output path for the encrypted file.
4. **Decrypt File:** Allows the user to select a file to decrypt and specify the output path for the decrypted file.
5. **Exit:** Terminates the program.
